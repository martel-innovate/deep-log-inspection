## Installing with docker-compose
Installing and running the Deep Log Inspection system requires [git][1] and [docker][2], so make sure they are installed on your system before proceeding.

Open your system's command line and `cd` to the folder where the project will be stored. Then, download the project by cloning the git repository:

    git clone https://github.com/martel-innovate/deep-log-monasca-elk.git

To install and run the system, you can start from [the README][3].
